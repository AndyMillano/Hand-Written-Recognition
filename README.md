# Hand-Written-Recognition
The aim of this project is to solve one of the outgoing researches of hand written recognition, this project is an attempt to beat the benchmarks set for the algorithms described in the 1998 paper by LeCun et al., plus some newer algorithms that have become popular, using the MNIST database of handwritten digits. I will be trying to implement solutions using K-N_N and MLP (neural network to solve this data sets).
